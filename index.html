<h2>Background</h2> 
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Wendy Perrotti. I am 24 years old and originally from the Bay Area in California. I currently live in
Montana with my lovely husband of almost 4 years and my sweet Alaskan Malamute named Elvis. I've been in the Air Force for just under 
5 years. I’ve been only stationed here but I've been able to travel a lot, especially since I am going on my third deployment so far. 
When it comes to my occupation, I am a construction worker who's scope consists of a wide range of work. In general, I really enjoy my 
job. It's a career field I never thought I'd find myself in but have learned to love. My grandpa was a mason, my father was an 
electrician and my mom an operating engineer, meaning construction is in my blood. But I know this is something I don’t want to do the 
rest of my life. This is part of my push of going to college and getting my computer programming degree. I have a few hopes of where I 
would like this to take me but nothing set in stone yet. Getting my degree is also very close to my heart since I am a first generation 
American and college student. I am also the oldest of 6 siblings and constantly strive to a be a great role model for them. Anyone who
knows me personally, knows I adore my siblings as if they were my own. These are just some of the things that make me, me!</p>

In this paragraph we delve into my current hobbies and try to become more personable to the readers. In the last line I display an image
of myself welding, one of my favorite hobbies.
 -->
<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
<p>There was a point in my adulthood where I would say "I don't have time for hobbies" but it wasn't until my husband told me you need to
 get a life (not in a mean way) where I really started focusing on avoiding time wasting activities like Netflix and my phone and started
 getting back into activities that I enjoyed. When it comes to hobbies, I have many that are very much inspired by husband and some that I
 just like to do. Firstly, I love to draw especially realism or dark/horror themed drawings. I enjoy welding very much; this has
 become just another form of art for me. I love to cook especially healthy meals. I was even vegan for a short period of my life and it 
really inspired me to incorporate more vegetables in my life today. I love to work out whether it is lifting weights, running or 
calisthenics, on a recent note I just made the 500lb club. And lastly the hobby that really makes me, me, is the passion I have for 
self-progression and trying out new things.</p>
