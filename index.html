<h1><br>Who is Wendy</h1>
<h2>Background</h2> 
<p>Hello eveyone, my name is Wendy Perrotti! I am 24 years old and originally from the Bay Area in California. I currently live in
Montana with my lovely husband of almost 4 years and my sweet Alaskan Malamute named Elvis. I've been in the Air Force for almost 5 years.
My occupation is a construction worker that consist of a wide range of work. In general I really enjoy my job. It's a career field I
never thought I'd find my self in but have learned to love it. My grandpa worked with concrete, my father was a electrician and my mom an
operating engineer, meaning construction has been in my blood line. I have recognized though that I don't always want to have to do this
the rest of my life. Leading to my goal of getting my Computer Progrogramming degree. I have a few hopes of where I would like this to take
me but nothing set in stone yet. Getting my degree is also very close to my heart since I am a first generation American on my dad's side
and the first to go to college. I am also the oldest of 6 siblings and constanly strive to a be a great role modle for them. Anyone who
knows me personally, knows I adore my siblings as if they were my own. </p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
<p>There was a point in my adulthood where I would say "I don't have time for hobbies" but it wasn't untill my husband told me you need
to get a life where I really stated focusing on getting back into activites that I enjoy. So when it comes to hobbies I have many that 
are very much inspired by husband and some that I just like to do. These can include: I love to draw especially realism or dark/horror
themed drawings, I enjoy welding very much just another form of art for me, I love to cooks esspecially very healthy meals I was even 
vegan for a short period of my life and it really inspired me to incoprate more vegetables in my life today, I love to workout whether it
is lifting weights, running or calestians I am about the sweat. And lastly the "hobbie" that really makes me, me, is the the passion I have
for self progression and trying out new things. </p>
