<h3 class="center">Instructions</h3>
<p> 
1.<u>Cut piece:</u> Measure past the large hole at least two inches each way. Take that measurement and transfer it to the drywall piece 
using the pencil and straight edge. Score along the lines using the utility knife. Bend along the score to seperate your drywall piece.<br><br>

2.<u>Prepare hole:</u> Take the drywall piece, place over large hole and outline. Once outlined use the utitly knife to score and the 
serated drywall knife to cut along the line. Once cut remove the remaining drywall.<br><br>

3.<u>Attatch backer:</u> If there is no studs available cut a plywood backer. This should be a few inches longer the the width of the hole.
Place the back into the hole along the long sides of the drywall edge, half exposed half covered by the drywall. Secure the backer
by screwing through the drywall to the backer. Repeat this on the bottom backer. <br><br>

4.<u>Attach new drywall:</u> Place the drywall piece that was cut for this spot. Ensure there is not more than a 1/8th inch gap around the edges.
Secure drywall to backing with the screws.<br><br>

5.<u>Mesh tape:</u> Attached the adhesive mesh tape along the seam, placing it in the center of the seam. Make sure to line it flat with no 
wrinkels or twists.<br><br>

6.<u>Mud Sand Repeat:</u> Using your 6-inch mud knife apply a thin layer of joint compund over the drywall tape. After it is dry lightly sand
surface. Then apply another thin coat of mud extending two inches past the first coat. Then sand or sponge smooth. If nessesary repeat 
with a third coat. <br><br>

7.<u>Finishing Touches:</u> Optionaly depending where this hole is at you may need to add texture, prime and paint!
